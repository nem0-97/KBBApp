To run use KBBAppV2 client to upload prop files to server in KBBAppV2 project to set it up
Then keep KBBAppV2 server running and run KBBAppV6 on Tomcat(I used apache-tomcat-7.0.34 as the server to run KBBAppV6 on) to connect to server through browser interface
I also used Eclipse to run everything just in case you were wondering
